Snip is a model with methods for getting templates from files. Snip's members track the location and relationships between template tags and file names.

Snip's dependencies are: 
	1. file.js: 
		1.1. rsvp
		1.2. nodejs fs
	2. backbone,js
		2.1. underscore.js
			2.1.1. nodejs jquery (Nodejs jquery does not use the dom since it is used on the server.)
